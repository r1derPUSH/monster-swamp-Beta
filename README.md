## ﻿🐸 Monster Swamp — Beta Release
Welcome to the chaotic swamp of code! This is the Beta version of the Monster Swamp game, and let's be honest — the code is messy. Like, 3500+ lines of code 🙃.

## 🌐 Live version:
▶ Play Monster Swamp Beta (https://r1derpush.github.io/monster-swamp-Beta/)

## ❗ Warning
This version is more of a proof of chaos than a clean release.
The structure is temporary, styles are experimental, and logic is, well... evolving. Expect:

Long files without proper componentization

Debug code left in many places

Experimental features

Performance issues on low-end devices

## 💡 What's next?
 Refactor and split code into modules

 Optimize animations and logic

 Add mobile support

 Polish UI/UX

## > ❗ This was my first big vanilla JS game — over 3500 lines of raw, unstructured, chaotic code. It works, but it’s not pretty 😅  
## > I’m keeping it public to show my growth and remind myself how far I've come.  
## > A full OOP rework is coming in a future project. Stay tuned 🚀  

to be continued...
